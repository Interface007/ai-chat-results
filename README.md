# ai-chat-results

A place to store interesting chat results from different AI implementations.

My goal with this repo is to store chat results that I find interesting or insightful. It will not contain any personal "real world" information. I experimented with different ways to query the AI using various scenarios.

Warning:
Most information presented here is NOT fact-checked by me. I will sometimes highlight how an AI is wrong in its answers, but not always.
